The Real-time Health Monitoring System is designed to monitor and analyze patient health data, focusing on heart rate (HR) and blood oxygen levels (SpO2). The system uses IoT sensors to collect real-time data, applies advanced algorithms to filter out noisy readings, and employs anomaly detection to provide early alerts to healthcare providers, significantly improving patient outcomes.

Key Features :
Heart Rate & SpO2 Accuracy Enhancement: Developed a filtering algorithm that eliminated 90% of noisy readings, 
                                                enhancing the accuracy of heart rate and SpO2 from 70% to 95%.
Anomaly Detection: Implemented anomaly detection, reducing emergency response times from 5 minutes to 90 seconds,
                                                  allowing for quicker intervention and better patient outcomes.
Real-Time Monitoring: Integrated IoT sensors to gather real-time health data, 
                                                  allowing continuous patient monitoring.
Responsive Dashboard: Built a responsive web-based dashboard using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
                                        providing users with an intuitive interface for monitoring patient vitals.
